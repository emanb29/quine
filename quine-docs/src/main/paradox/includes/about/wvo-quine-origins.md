Willard Van Orman Quine was a 20th century teacher and philosopher of logic and
science. Though influenced by logical positivism, Quine rejected the notion of
a distinction between analytical truths and empirical truths. Instead, he
maintained that both logic (and math) and science were subject to empirical
rules and could be refined through observation and the examination of
countervailing evidence.

It was Quine’s work @link:[Two Dogmas of Empiricism](https://thereitis.org/quines-two-dogmas-of-empiricism/) that inspired the project’s name.
According to Ryan Wright, the original developer of Quine, “About 2 years into
the development of Quine the system, I started to realize that many of his
ideas had very direct parallels in the system I’d been developing. For example,
Quine’s interesting sidebar in 'Two Dogmas’ where he asks, ‘which points in
Ohio are starting points?’ impressed me as being related to indexes in Quine.
Hence the name.”
