/** A query (part) can be conceived of as a collection of individual updates to a node. Those updates can be applied
  * individually, though sometimes multiple updates are important to consider as a unit.
  * Considering a single update, there are 3 effects to consider:
  *   1. Testing for and computing the effect, if any. Decides `hasEffect` and pins down a specific EventTime.
  *   2. Updating in-memory state. This causes queries to return updated results, and triggers standing queries.
  *   3. Saving data durably to disk through the persistor.
  *
  * There are three distinct parties participating in the update:
  *   a. the node: materialized state of the node, single process to determine updates and resolve a query
  *   b. the persistor: saves events to disk, confirming when durably stored
  *   c. the query issuer: conveys user preferences and receives the confirmation (or failure) of node updates.
  *
  * These strategies affect the order of operations for the participating parties and their respective effects.

    * - In the presence of persistor failure, query and standing query results can be visible for changes never
    *   saved to disk
